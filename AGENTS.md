# AGENTS.md

Pure-Harn Google Workspace connector for Drive and Gmail change notifications.

Shared connector authoring rules live in the Harn guide:

- [Connector authoring guide](https://github.com/burin-labs/harn/blob/main/docs/src/connectors/authoring.md)

Put shared connector guidance in the Harn guide and keep only
provider-specific notes and local hazards here.

`CLAUDE.md` points here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Provider notes

- Keep API calls scoped to the Google API hosts allowlisted in `src/lib.harn`.
- Use the exact Drive, Docs, and Gmail scopes declared in `harn.toml`.
- Treat Drive push headers as wake-up signals; the stored `changes.list` page
  token is the durable source of change details.

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Build ambitious outcomes behind small typed interfaces; give behavior one owner
  and generate or parity-test projections instead of duplicating policy.
- Work autonomously within approved scope. Pause for destructive or production effects,
  exceptional spend, material ambiguity, or new authority.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, pivot, and steer as control events.
- Use the smallest owning product-path check. Add a falsifier for contested, load-bearing,
  or potentially vacuous claims; record controls, recovery, and blind spots.
- Evidence follows source/artifact identity. Reuse proof when relevant code, build inputs,
  and dependencies are unchanged. Repeat affected checks for relevant changes, failures,
  deployment, or packaging differences. Do not rebuild or recapture solely for main.
- Ship means owning-main integration with terminal merge and applicable release/deploy
  checks. Confirm landed content and result; an open PR is incomplete.
- Use `ship` with a deployed Smart Ship caller; otherwise use `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
  Never use `--admin`; incidents use `bypass-ci`, `bypass-merge-queue`, or `force-merge`.

## Pull request titles

Use `[Area] Sentence case summary`, for example
`[Connector] Verify the webhook signature before parsing the payload`. The
summary starts with a capital letter and does not end with a period. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for scope rules and the files this
repository does not accept hand edits to.
